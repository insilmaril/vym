    the help section It also can be downloaded from the vym site at
    Sourceforge:

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/vym/

site:

Installation
------------

* Binaries

    Installation depends on the platform you use, please check the
    homepage for details:

	http://www.insilmaril.de/vym

* Compiling

    Compiling vym from scratch is pretty easy, if you have the
    development packages of the Qt5 toolkit installed. (Check also the
    homepage above for details):

    qmake
    make
    make install

* Testing (without installing!)

    You can also run vym virtually in your webbrowser: vym is available
    as appliance in SUSE Studio. SUSE Studio is a very easy way to
    create appliances, which are customized Linux operating systems.

    All you need is to quickly create a free account and search for
    "vym" by user "insilmaril" in the gallery:

	http://susestudio.com

    The appliance can be downloaded as installable iso image, or run in
    the testdrive - in your webbrowser! That's a bit slow, but gives you
    an idea without having to install anything at all on your system.
