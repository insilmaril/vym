            "<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your "
            "freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General "
            "Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and "
            "change free software--to make sure the software is free for all "
            "its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the "
            "Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program "
            "whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software "
            "Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public "
            "License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>"

            "<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, "
            "not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure "
            "that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software "
            "(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive "
            "source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the "
            "software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you "
            "know you can do these things.</p>"

            "<p>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that "
            "forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender "
            "the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain "
            "responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the "
            "software, or if you modify it.</p>"

            "<p>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, "
            "whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the "
            "rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive "
            "or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms "
            "so they know their rights.</p>"

            "<p>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the "
            "software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal "
            "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>"

            "<p>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make "
            "certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for "
            "this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else "
            "and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have "
            "is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others "
            "will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>"

            "<p>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by "
            "software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that "
            "redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent "
            "licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent "
            "this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for "
            "everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>"

            "<p align=\"center\">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, "
            "DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>"

            "<p>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which "
            "contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be "
            "distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "
            "\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "
            "\"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any "
            "derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work "
            "containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or "
            "with modifications and/or translated into another language.  "
            "(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the "
            "term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as "
            "\"you\".</p>"

            "<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification "
            "are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The "
            "act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from "
            "the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work "
            "based on the Program (independent of having been made by running "
            "the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program "
            "does.</p>"

            "<p>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the "
            "Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided "
            "that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an "
            "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep "
            "intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the "
            "absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the "
            "Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>"

            "<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a "
            "copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in "
            "exchange for a fee.</p>"

            "<p>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any "
            "portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy "
            "and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of "
            "Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these "
            "conditions:"
            "<ol type=\"a\">"
            "<li> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices "
            "stating that you changed the files and the date of any "
            "change.</li>"

            "<li> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that "
            "in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or "
            "any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all "
            "third parties under the terms of this License.</li>"

            "<li> If the modified program normally reads commands "
            "interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running "
            "for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or "
            "display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice "
            "and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you "
            "provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program "
            "under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy "
            "of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is "
            "interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, "
            "your work based on the Program is not required to print an "
            "announcement.)</li>"
            "</ol>"
            "</p>"

            "<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If "
            "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the "
            "Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and "
            "separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, "
            "do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as "
            "separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as "
            "part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the "
            "distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, "
            "whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, "
            "and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>"

            "<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or "
            "contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the "
            "intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of "
            "derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>"

            "<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the "
            "Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on "
            "a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the "
            "other work under the scope of this License.</p>"

            "<p>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based "
            "on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under "
            "the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one "

            "software interchange; or,</li>"

            "    <li> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least "
            "three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than "
            "your cost of physically performing source distribution, a "
            "complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, "
            "to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a "
            "medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>"

            "    <li> Accompany it with the information you received as to the "

            "received the program in object code or executable form with such "
            "an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</li>"
            "</ol></p>"

            "<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the "

            "contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus "
            "the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the "
            "executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code "

            "components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system "
            "on which the executable runs, unless that component itself "
            "accompanies the executable.</p>"

            "<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by "

            "<p>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the "
            "Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any "
            "attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the "
            "Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights "
            "under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, "
            "or rights, from you under this License will not have their "
            "licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full "
            "compliance.</p>"

            "<p>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you "
            "have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission "
            "to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  "
            "These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this "
            "License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or "
            "any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of "
            "this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for "
            "copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on "
            "it.</p>"

            "<p>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based "
            "on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license "
            "from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the "
            "Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not "
            "impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of "
            "the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing "
            "compliance by third parties to this License.</p>"

            "<p>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of "
            "patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to "
            "patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court "
            "order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of "
            "this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this "
            "License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy "
            "simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other "
            "pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not "
            "distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license "
            "would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by "
            "all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, "
            "then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License "
            "would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>"

            "<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or "
            "unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of "
            "the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is "
            "intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>"

            "<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to "
            "infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest "
            "validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of "
            "protecting the integrity of the free software distribution "
            "system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many "
            "people have made generous contributions to the wide range of "
            "software distributed through that system in reliance on "
            "consistent application of that system; it is up to the "
            "author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute "
            "software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose "
            "that choice.</p>"

            "<p>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is "
            "restricted in certain countries either by patents or by "
            "copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places "
            "the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical "
            "distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that "
            "distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus "
            "excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation "
            "as if written in the body of this License.</p>"

            "<p>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or "
            "new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  "
            "Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present "
            "version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or "
            "concerns.</p>"

            "<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the "
            "Program specifies a version number of this License which applies "
            "to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following "
            "the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later "
            "version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the "
            "Program does not specify a version number of this License, you "
            "may choose any version ever published by the Free Software "
            "Foundation.</p>"

            "<p>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into "
            "other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, "
            "write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is "
            "copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free "
            "Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our "
            "decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free "
            "status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting "
            "the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>"
